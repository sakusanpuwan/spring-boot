# Maven
Apache Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can from a central piece of information: 

- build a JAR file
- manage dependencies and their versions
- run your application locally 
- run unit tests
- deploy to an environment

Maven is a powerful build automation tool used primarily for Java projects. It has a defined lifecycle that consists of several phases. Each phase represents a stage in the project build process, allowing developers to manage the build effectively. Hereâ€™s a brief explanation of the different stages of the Maven build lifecycle:

### Maven Build Lifecycle Stages
0. **clean**
   - **Purpose**: Remove the `target` directory and clean up the project.
   - **What Happens**: When you run `mvn clean`, Maven deletes the `target` directory where all the compiled classes, packaged JAR/WAR files, and other artifacts generated during the build process are stored. This ensures that subsequent builds start from a clean state, eliminating the possibility of conflicts or issues caused by leftover files from previous builds
1. **validate**
    - **Purpose**: Validate the project structure and configuration.
    - **What Happens**: Checks if the project is correctly configured and the necessary information is available. If any validation fails, the build process is halted.

2. **compile**
    - **Purpose**: Compile the source code.
    - **What Happens**: Maven compiles the source code from the `src/main/java` directory into bytecode, which is stored in the `target/classes` directory.

3. **test**
    - **Purpose**: Run unit tests.
    - **What Happens**: Maven runs the unit tests (located in `src/test/java`) using a testing framework (like JUnit). The tests are executed against the compiled code to ensure functionality.

4. **package**
    - **Purpose**: Package the compiled code.
    - **What Happens**: Maven packages the compiled code into a distributable format, such as a JAR (Java Archive) or WAR (Web Application Archive), depending on the project type. The packaged file is placed in the `target` directory.

5. **verify**
    - **Purpose**: Verify the package integrity and quality.
    - **What Happens**: Runs any checks to ensure the packaged code is valid and meets quality standards. This can include running additional tests or checks.

6. **install**
    - **Purpose**: Install the package into the local repository.
    - **What Happens**: Maven copies the packaged file to the local Maven repository (usually located in `~/.m2/repository`), making it available for other projects on the same machine.

7. **deploy**
    - **Purpose**: Deploy the package to a remote repository.
    - **What Happens**: Maven uploads the packaged file to a remote repository (like Nexus or Artifactory), making it available for use by other developers or projects in the organization.
